                Women have been declining in the tech industry, worldwide. By 2043 at the current trend less than 1% of
                the global tech workforce will be female. In Pakistan, women represent only 14% of the IT workforce and
                13% of IT managers. To tackle the gender parity issue in the tech field and to create a pipeline of
                women in tech, Engro has partnered with Circle Women Association to run technological trainings for
                young girls from underserved communities under the Tech Karo initiative.

                Since the programâ€™s inception in 2019, Tech Karo has successfully completed six technological training
                programs whereby teaching tech and life skills to 250+ young girls and boys from underserved communities
                (65% female) and placing these graduates in jobs and internships to equip them with financial freedom.

                To scale up the program, the program moved to blended learning approach in 2020, to formalize
                partnerships and achieve operational excellence while moving towards program sustainability, and
                recognition as a premier platform for women in tech. For the year of 2020, we aim to run 6 courses
                altogether and train 250+ youth (65% female) in Web Development, Digital Marketing, and Graphic Design
                courses.
